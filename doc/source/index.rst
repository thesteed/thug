Welcome to Thug's documentation!
================================

`Thug <https://github.com/buffer/thug>`_ is a Python low-interaction honeyclient based on an hybrid 
static/dynamic analysis approach.

Thug provides a DOM implementation which is (almost) compliant with W3C DOM Core, HTML, Events,
Views and Style specifications (Level 1, 2 and partially 3). [#f1]_

Thug makes use of the Google V8 Javascript engine [#f2]_ wrapped through PyV8 [#f3]_ in order to
analyze malicious Javascript code and of the Libemu library [#f4]_ wrapped through Pylibemu [#f5]_
in order to detect and emulate shellcodes.

Currently 8 Internet Explorer (Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows 7), 6 Chrome (Windows XP,
Windows 7, MacOS X, Android 4.0.3, Linux), 3 Firefox (Windows XP, Windows 7, Linux) and 3 Safari 
(Windows XP, Windows 7, MacOS X) personalities are emulated and about 90 vulnerability modules 
(ActiveX controls, core browser functionalities, browser plugins) are provided.

.. [#f2] `Google V8 <http://code.google.com/p/v8/>`_ is Google's open source JavaScript engine. V8 is written in C++ and is used in Google Chrome, the open source browser from Google.
         V8 implements ECMAScript as specified in ECMA-262, 3rd edition, and runs on Windows XP and Vista, Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard), and Linux systems that use IA-32 or ARM processors.
         V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

.. [#f3] `PyV8 <http://code.google.com/p/pyv8/>`_ is a Python wrapper for the Google V8 engine. PyV8 acts as a bridge between the Python and JavaScript objects and supports the Google 
         V8 engine in Python scripts.

.. [#f4] `Libemu <http://libemu.carnivore.it/>`_ is a small library written in C offering basic x86 emulation and shellcode detection using GetPC heuristics. It is designed to be used 
         within network intrusion/prevention detections and honeypots.

.. [#f5] `Pylibemu <https://github.com/buffer/pylibemu>`_ is a Libemu Cython wrapper
